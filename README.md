Haskell Chomp
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

[Chomp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp) is a simple
mathematical two-player game perhaps best described as "2D
[Nim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)". This Haskell
program plays perfect Chomp against a human using adversary
search. It's currently set up to play 4x3 Chomp with the
human moving first.
